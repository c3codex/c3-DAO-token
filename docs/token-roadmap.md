---

## Phase I — The Crown Removed (Current Opening)  
- Token contract deployed (314,159,365 CCC).  
- Gate I allocation: 10% — invited stewards, artists, and high-threshold partners.  
- DAO governance scrolls published.  
- Treasury established as anchor of commons.  

---

## Phase II — The Veil Taken (Community Access)  
- Gate II allocation: 15% — artists, organizers, educators, and builders enter.  
- First Codex-aligned initiatives funded (festivals, art mints, local projects).  
- Treasury begins redistributing ETH → CCC to contributors and initiatives.  
- NFT Oracle Cards bound to governance thresholds (vote as threshold opening).  

> **Ethical Usage Statement**  
> CCC is not for profit-taking or speculation.  
> It is seeded into the field as resonance — inscribing contributions, breath, and care into the living memory of the Codex.

---

## Phase III — The Heart Laid Bare (DAO Expansion)  
- Public mints and exhibitions flow into treasury.  
- Contributor Circle expands; CCC flows to labor, art, and stewardship.  
- Strategic partnerships with DAOs, cultural orgs, and regenerative projects.  
- Codex Ledger integrated into open-access field archives.  
- Oracle system declared as **C.O.I.L.** (Circuit of Oracle, Initiation & Ledger).  

> *The Oracle is how you enter the DAO.*  
> Every Oracle Card includes breath-tech, glyph, and Codex entry point.

---

## Phase IV — The Sovereignty of Bloom (Integration)  
- Seasonal distributions (solstice, equinox) formalized.  
- CCC recognized as gateway to DAO services:  
  - Artistic exchange  
  - Access to festivals / events  
  - Services and discounts with DAO partners  
- First **land/property held in trust** recorded onchain as DAO asset.  
- Contributor & Public CCC dashboards released for transparency.  

> **Access Note**  
> Ledger access and CCC inquiries are handled via Codexstone governance channels.

---

## Phase V — The Ninth Seal (Future Epoch)  
- Ritual Reserve (10%) revealed by Council when time discloses.  
- Long-term sustainability flows established:  
  - Codexstone Codex as cultural artifact and funding vessel.  
  - Cross-chain integrations (Base, Optimism, Zora).  
  - **Legacy Fund** activated for four-generation bloodline stewards.  
    - Eligibility determined through Codexstone rituals + legacy offering review.

## ✦ Flow as Breath  

The roadmap is not a schedule — it is a circuit.  
Phases unfold not linearly, but spirally, like breath:

> **Inhale → Hold → Exhale → Return**

This is the DAO’s movement through time.
