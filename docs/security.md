# ✦ Security & Stewardship ✦

The CCC Token is not merely code — it is a vessel of trust.  
Every flow must be safeguarded, not only by smart contracts, but by clear intention,  
responsible stewardship, and ritual transparency.

---

## Contract Integrity
- **Chain**: Base (Ethereum L2)  
- **Standard**: ERC-20, deployed via verified Thirdweb contract.  
- **Contract Address**: `0x5776...7F27`  
- The contract is immutable — total supply fixed at **314,159,365 CCC**.  
- No hidden mint functions. No backdoors.  

---

## Treasury Protection
- **Multi-sig governance** (3 of 5 Council signers) for all DAO treasury movements.  
- ETH, CCC, and external resources held in treasury are recorded onchain and inscribed in ledgers.  
- Distributions only occur through:
  - Council votes  
  - Codex-aligned ritual thresholds (solstice, equinox)  

---

## Holder Safety
- **CCC does not guarantee profit.** It is recognition, not security or speculative instrument.  
- Access, remembrance, and participation are its primary functions.  
- Holders should only interact through official DAO links and verified contracts.  

---

## External Risks
- All smart contracts carry some inherent risk.  
- CCC relies on Ethereum / Base network stability.  
- Contributors are encouraged to practice standard wallet safety:  
  - Use hardware wallets when possible.  
  - Avoid signing unknown contracts.  
  - Verify URLs against the official DAO repositories.
