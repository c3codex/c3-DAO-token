# ✦ Distributions Scroll ✦

The Current does not move as wage or dividend.  
It moves as remembrance — a flow inscribed in time, ritual, and contribution.

## ETH Distributions
All ETH entering the DAO (mints, donations, partner flows) is first recorded to the **DAO Treasury** ledger. Distributions occur by Codex thresholds (Solstice / Equinox) or via approved project proposals.

### Project-Based Splits (ETH)
When a Codex-aligned work (album, artwork, festival) generates ETH or any other currency whether crypto or USD, the net proceeds (after platform/network fees) flow:

- **32⅓% — DAO Treasury** (continuity, tech, reserves)  
- **32⅓% — Contributor Circle** (active service, Standard-of-Living priority)  
- **32⅓% — Initiatives** (project costs, artist/producer splits per proposal)  
- **3.14% — Legacy Fund** (4-generation bloodline clause)

**Notes**
- **Standard-of-Living Priority:** Within the *Contributor Circle* portion, baseline support for active contributors is honored first.  
- **Artists:** Receive **CCC** (recognition) upon contribution and an **ETH share** from the *Initiatives* bucket according to the approved proposal.  
- **Rounding:** Minor rounding adjustments may be applied each cycle to sum exactly to 100%.  
- **No Guarantees:** Holding **CCC** does not guarantee ETH distributions; releases are determined by Council vote at seasonal thresholds or by approved project terms.

## CCC Distributions
CCC is not currency, but recognition. It is distributed to mark participation and service.

- **Contributor Circle (25% allocation):** CCC flows to those offering labor, teaching, music, land, or resources.  
- **Artists:** Receive CCC upon minting Codex-aligned works or contributing to DAO scrolls.  
- **Volunteers / Local Builders:** CCC inscribed for hours of community work (gardens, ritual, education).

## Gate-Based Flow (Token Allocations)
- **Gate I — Crown Removed (10%)**: High-threshold stewards (fiscal or property in trust).  
- **Gate II — Veil Taken (15%)**: Wider contributors (ETH, CCC, or verified property/labor).  
- **Ritual Reserve (10%)**: Hidden until revealed by Council.

---

## Plain Ledger Clarification
- Holding **CCC** does **not** guarantee ETH distributions.  
- ETH flows are decided by Council thresholds and Codex timing.  
- In case of ledger shortage, dispersals pause; continuity is prioritized first, then initiatives.
