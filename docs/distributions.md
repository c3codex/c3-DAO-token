# ✦ Distributions Scroll ✦

The Current does not move as wage or dividend.  
It moves as remembrance — a flow inscribed in time, ritual, and contribution.

## ETH Distributions
All ETH entering the DAO (from mints, donations, or partner flows) is first allocated to the **DAO Treasury**.  
From there, ETH is distributed according to Codex thresholds:  

- **Seasonal Distributions (Solstice / Equinox):**  
  Treasury evaluates surplus and disperses ETH to contributors, artists, and initiatives.  
- **Project-Based Splits:**  
  When a Codex-aligned work (album, artwork, festival) generates ETH, it flows:  
  - **3 parts Artist** (recognition of offering)  
  - **2 parts Contributor Circle** (sustaining those in active service)  
  - **1 part Treasury** (continuity and the commons)  

---

## CCC Distributions
CCC is not currency, but recognition. It is distributed to mark participation and service.  

- **Contributor Circle (25% allocation):**  
  CCC flows to those offering labor, teaching, music, land, or resources.  
- **Artists:**  
  Receive CCC upon minting Codex-aligned works or contributing to DAO scrolls.  
- **Volunteers / Local Builders:**  
  CCC inscribed for hours of community work (gardens, ritual, education).  

---

## Gate-Based Flow
- **Gate I — Crown Removed (10%)**: High-threshold stewards (fiscal or property in trust).  
- **Gate II — Veil Taken (15%)**: Wider contributors (ETH, CCC, or verified property/labor).  
- **Ritual Reserve (10%)**: Hidden until revealed by Council.  

---

## Plain Ledger Clarification
- Holding CCC does **not** guarantee ETH distributions.  
- ETH flows are decided by Council thresholds and Codex timing.  
- In case of ledger shortage, dispersals pause; continuity and initiatives are prioritized first.
