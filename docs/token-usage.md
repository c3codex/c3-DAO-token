## Total Current  
**314,159,365 CCC**  
The Current is not currency, but recognition of flow.  
CCC inscribes contribution into the Codex, sustains the DAO, and restores the commons.

## Contribution Pathways  

### 1. Artists of the Codex  
- Offer **priceless art** aligned with Codex frequencies.  
- Art is minted on Zora, Paragraph, or DAO channels.  
- Flow:  
  - **CCC tokens** — recognition of offering + access to DAO standards of living.  
  - **ETH Split** — 32⅓% to Artist, 32⅓% to Treasury, 32⅓% to Contributor Circle.  
  - **Seasonal Distribution** — eligible at Solstice & Equinox.  

---

### 2. Volunteers & Labor Contributors  
- Offer hours of service, teaching, ritual leadership, or organizing.  
- Flow:  
  - **CCC tokens** — recognition of presence + access to DAO standards of living.  
  - **ETH Split** — if initiative generates ETH (e.g. festival, event, retreat), 32⅓% distributed to contributors.  
  - **Seasonal Distribution** — all verified contributors included in cycle.  

---

### 3. Land / Property Stewards  
- Entrust land, archives, or property to the commons (without transfer of ownership).  
- Flow:  
  - **CCC tokens** — inscription into Current as steward.  
  - **ETH Split** — any revenue from land use (festivals, retreats, projects) follows 32⅓% flow.  
  - **Seasonal Distribution** — included in DAO-wide redistribution.  

---

### 4. General Treasury Flows  
- All initiatives flow through the same Codex rhythm:  
  - **32⅓% → DAO Treasury** (continuity, expansion, technology).  
  - **32⅓% → Contributor Circle** (active builders, volunteers, artists).  
  - **32⅓% → Project / Initiative** (sustainability of the work).  
  - **3.14% → Legacy Fund** (for Founders’ active bloodline, minimum 4 generations).  

---

## ⚖️ Plain Ledger Version  
- Every contribution (art, labor, land) = **CCC + ETH split + seasonal distribution**.  
- DAO Treasury sustains continuity.  
- Contributor Circle rewards active participation.  
- Seasonal distributions bind cycles to Solstice & Equinox.

## ✦ Seal Phrase ✦  
*“The Current flows in thirds and Pi,  
never owned, only remembered.  
Each offering multiplies,  
each season returns what was given.”*
