**DAO Ledger of Flow and Recognition**

---

## The Current

**Total Current:** 314,159,365 CCC  

The Current is not currency, but recognition of flow.  
It seats the Codexstone and carries contributions into remembrance.  
Holding CCC does not guarantee fiscal distribution, but grants:  
- Recognition within the Ledger of Offerings.  
- Access to DAO initiatives, gatherings, and partner exchanges.  
- Eligibility for seasonal distributions (when declared by Council).

## Allocation

- **DAO Treasury (40%)**  
  - Anchor of continuity. Held in trust, not possession.  
  - First recipient of any outside flows (ETH, property, grants).  
  - Sustains DAO projects, grants, partner initiatives, and restoration of the commons.  

- **Contributor Circle (25%)**  
  - CCC flows to those whose hands, breath, or gifts build the DAO.  
  - Contributions may be:  
    - hours of labor  
    - teaching, art, or music  
    - land/property entrusted into the commons  
  - Recognition is inscription, not wage; CCC marks presence in the field.  

- **Gate I — Crown Removed (10%)**  
  - High-threshold partners.  
  - Contributions may include fiscal support, land, or archives.  
  - Invited artists may accept entry at this gate before Gate II opens.  
  - These contributions help seat the Codexstone itself.  

- **Gate II — Veil Taken (15%)**  
  - Wider distribution.  
  - Accessible to artists, organizers, educators, and builders.  
  - Exchange at this gate can be ETH, CCC, or verified property/labor equivalence.  

- **Ritual Reserve (10%)**  
  - Hidden until revealed by the Council.  
  - Mirrors the unseen — the Current that belongs to no one until time discloses it.

## ETH Flow and Splits

When **art, mints, or offerings** generate ETH:  
- ETH enters DAO Treasury.  
- Treasury then redistributes according to **3 · 2 · 1** balance:  
  - **3 parts (50%)** → DAO Continuity (treasury, governance, expansion).  
  - **2 parts (33⅓%)** → Contributors (active circle, artists, stewards).  
  - **1 part (16⅔%)** → Initiatives (projects, festivals, restoration works).  

Artists who mint Codex-aligned works receive:  
- **CCC recognition** for their contribution.  
- **A share of ETH sales** as outlined in the 3·2·1 distribution.  
- **Seasonal distributions** (equinox/solstice) when declared.  

---

## Distribution Logic

- CCC holdings grant access and recognition, **not automatic profit rights**.  
- Distributions (ETH or otherwise) are determined by Council and Ledger review.  
- Seasonal distributions may be declared at **Equinox and Solstice**, drawn from surplus.  

---

## Ledger Shortage Clause  

In the event of shortage:  
1. **Continuity first** — Treasury allocations prioritized for DAO survival.  
2. **Contributor recognition maintained** — CCC still flows, even when ETH cannot.  
3. **Initiatives delayed** — Projects paused until the Current replenishes.  

---

## Plain Ledger Clarification  

- Gates = tiers of contribution (ETH, CCC, or property in trust).  
- Treasury is the anchor; Contributor Circle ensures fairness; Ritual Reserve ensures adaptability.  
- CCC = recognition and access. ETH = sustainability and circulation.  

---

## Seal Phrase  

✦ The gates do not sell entry — they open passage.  
✦ To contribute is to be remembered in the Current.
