# ✦ CCC Tokenomics ✦  
**Codex Current of Contribution — Total Supply: 314,159,365 CCC**

The **Current** is not currency, but remembrance of flow.  
It seats the Codexstone and inscribes the contributions of partners, artists, and builders into the DAO’s living ledger.  
CCC also flows through **C.O.I.L.** — the Codex Oracle Interface Layer — where recognition, ritual, and resonance converge.

## ✦ Total Supply

- **Fixed Supply:** 314,159,365 CCC  
- **Symbol:** CCC  
- **Contract:** `[Insert contract address or Etherscan link]`  
- **Network:** Ethereum Base Layer 2 (Base)

---

## ✦ Allocation

### DAO Treasury — 40%
- Anchor of continuity.  
- Held in trust, not possession.  
- Fuels DAO projects, grants, partner initiatives, and restoration of the commons.

### Contributor Circle — 25%
- CCC flows to those whose hands, breath, or gifts build the DAO.  
- Contributions include:
  - hours of labor  
  - teaching, art, or music  
  - land or property entrusted into the commons  
- Recognition is inscription into the Current, not a wage.

### Gate I — Crown Removed — 10%
- High-threshold partners seat the Codexstone.  
- Contributions may include fiscal support, archives, or sacred property.  
- These offerings inscribe stewardship at the foundation.

### Gate II — Veil Taken — 15%
- Wider access, extending beyond direct invitation.  
- Artists, educators, organizers, and local builders may enter.  
- Exchange can be ETH, CCC, or verified property/labor equivalence.

### Ritual Reserve — 10%
- Held in shadow until revealed by the Council.  
- Mirrors the unseen Current — not owned, but disclosed by epoch.

## ✦ Flow Logic

- **ETH & external inflows** → First allocated to DAO Treasury.  
- Treasury then distributes in **3·2·1 rhythm**:  
  - 3 parts → DAO continuity & projects  
  - 2 parts → Contributor Circle  
  - 1 part → Initiatives & field experiments

- **CCC Distributions** are recognition, not profit guarantee:  
  - Artists mint Codex-aligned works → ETH enters treasury → CCC inscribed to artist + circle.  
  - DAO contributors receive CCC for presence, teaching, and creation.  
  - CCC grants access to DAO initiatives, rituals, and partner exchanges.

---

## ✦ Ledger Clauses

- **Ledger Shortage Clause:**  
  If continuity is threatened, dispersals redirect first from distributions, then from initiatives, before Treasury core is touched.

- **Recognition Clause:**  
  Holding CCC does not guarantee ETH distributions.  These are declared by Council vote at **Solstice and Equinox thresholds.**

## ✦ Access & Utility  

Holding **CCC** is recognition in the Current — and carries with it living access:  

- **DAO Initiatives** → entry to festivals, retreats, and Codex-led gatherings.  
- **Artistic Exchange** → CCC may be redeemed for contributions of art, music, or workshops from DAO partners.  
- **Services & Discounts** → tokens can be exchanged with aligned partners (healers, teachers, builders) for services or reduced contribution rates.  
- **Council Thresholds** → CCC-holders gain presence in proposal flows and ritual votes, though governance weight remains tied to NFTs.  
- **Ritual Access** → CCC serves as a key to gated Codexstone experiences (Oracle draws, breath-tech sessions, C.O.I.L. activations).  

CCC is **not a guarantee of return**, but a passage into the field of recognition, participation, and shared sovereignty.
