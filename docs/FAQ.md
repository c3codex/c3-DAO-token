# ✦ CCC Token FAQ ✦

## What is the CCC Token?
The CCC (c3 Current Token) is not currency, but recognition of flow.  
It seats the Codexstone and carries contributions into remembrance.  

Holding CCC signifies presence, contribution, and access within the DAO.

---

## How many CCC tokens exist?
- **Total Supply:** 314,159,365 CCC  
- Distribution:  
  - Treasury: 40%  
  - Contributor Circle: 25%  
  - Gate I (Crown Removed): 10%  
  - Gate II (Veil Taken): 15%  
  - Ritual Reserve: 10%

---

## Does holding CCC guarantee profits?
✦ No. CCC is **recognition of contribution**, not a guarantee of financial return.  
Distributions (ETH or otherwise) are determined by DAO governance and availability of treasury resources.

---

## How do I receive CCC?
- Contribute to DAO initiatives (art, teaching, labor, property entrusted into commons).  
- Participate in Gates I or II.  
- Be invited as an artist/partner aligned with the Codex.  

---

## What can CCC be used for?
- Access to DAO events and ritual calls.  
- Artistic and knowledge exchange within DAO partners.  
- Recognition of contribution in governance records.  
- Exchange for services, discounts, or participation offered by DAO partners.

## How is ETH (or external resources) distributed?
ETH received flows first into the DAO Treasury.  
From there:  
1. Treasury continuity is secured.  
2. Contributor Circle allocations are made.  
3. Solstice and Equinox distributions (if any) are released.  
CCC holdings may serve as eligibility for recognition, but distributions are not automatic.  

---

## What are the "Gates"?
The Gates are ceremonial openings of contribution:  
- **Gate I (Crown Removed):** High-threshold partners, artists, and stewards who seat the Codexstone.  
- **Gate II (Veil Taken):** Wider community access with ETH, CCC, or property/labor equivalence.  

---

## What is the Ritual Reserve?
10% of CCC held unseen until revealed by the Council in future epochs.  
It safeguards adaptability and ensures continuity through the unknown.

---

## Is CCC a governance token?
CCC is not a voting token.  
Governance rights flow through Codex NFTs, which seat decisions in resonance rather than currency.
