# ✦ The Current Allocation Scroll ✦  

**Total Current: 314,159,365 CCC**  

The Current is not currency, but recognition of flow.  
It seats the Codexstone and carries contributions into remembrance.  

---

## DAO Treasury (40%)  
- Anchor of continuity. Held in trust, not possession.  
- Sustains DAO projects, grants, partner initiatives, restoration of the commons.  

---

## Contributor Circle (25%)  
- CCC flows to those whose hands, breath, or gifts build the DAO.  
- Contribution can be:  
  - hours of labor  
  - teaching, art, or music  
  - land/property entrusted into the commons  
- Recognition is not payment but inscription into the Current.  

---

## Gate I — Crown Removed (10%)  
✦ High-threshold partners.  
✦ Exchange may be fiscal, but also land, archives, or sacred property held in trust.  
✦ These are the stewards who help seat the Codexstone — not with transaction, but with contribution.  

- **Stewards:** high-threshold partners offering fiscal support, land, or archives.  
- **Artists:** invited by the Council to inscribe the Codex with works aligned to the DAO.  
- These contributions seat the Codexstone itself.  

---

## Gate II — Veil Taken (15%)  
- Broader passage, extending beyond invitations.  
- Accessible to artists, organizers, educators, and local builders.  
- Exchange at this gate can be ETH, CCC, or verified property/labor equivalence.  

---

## Ritual Reserve (10%)  
- Hidden until revealed by the Council.  
- Mirrors the unseen — the Current that belongs to no one until time discloses it.  

---

## ⚖️ Plain Ledger Clarification  
- Invited artists may accept entry before Gate II opens.  
- Gates = tiers of contribution, measured in ETH, property in trust, or verified hours/labor.  
- Treasury is largest allocation for sustainability.  
- Contributor Circle rewards ongoing participation.  
- Ritual Reserve safeguards adaptability.
