## âœ¦ Purpose  
The CCC token is not a speculative asset â€” it is a **Current**.  
- âœ¦ It honors contribution (labor, art, stewardship, ritual).  
- âœ¦ It anchors governance access (paired with DAO NFTs).  
- âœ¦ It sustains commons restoration through distribution gates.  

The token flows back into community â€” as recognition, not as debt.

## âœ¦ NFT Access

- âœ¦ Holding a DAO NFT grants a vote (threshold-based).  
- âœ¦ CCC may be distributed alongside, but never replaces the sovereignty of member presence.
