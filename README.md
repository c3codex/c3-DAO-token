# ✦ c3 DAO Token — The Current ✦  

**Repository for the c3 DAO Token (CCC), the Current of c3 Community Partners DAO.**  
This repo contains documentation, contracts, and symbolic assets for the CCC token, which flows through the c3 DAO as a means of recognition, access, and continuity.

## ✦ Purpose  
The CCC token is not a speculative asset — it is a **Current**.  
- ✦ It honors contribution (labor, art, stewardship, ritual).  
- ✦ It anchors governance access (paired with DAO NFTs).  
- ✦ It sustains commons restoration through distribution gates.  

The token flows back into community — as recognition, not as debt.

## ✦ Tokenomics at a Glance  
**Total Supply:** 314,159,269 CCC  
**Distribution:**  
- **Gate I — Crown Removed (10%)**: Public opening, first flow into the field.  
- **Gate II — Veil Taken (15%)**: Extended community access.  
- **Treasury (40%)**: Sustains DAO projects, grants, partner initiatives.  
- **Contributor Circle (25%)**: Rewarding those who create, contribute, and hold the Current.  
- **Ritual Reserve (10%)**: Held in shadow, revealed in future epochs.

## ✦ NFT Access  
While CCC tokens recognize contribution and flow, **DAO governance access is anchored by NFTs**.  
- ✦ Holding a DAO NFT grants a vote (threshold-based).  
- ✦ CCC may be distributed alongside, but never replaces the sovereignty of member presence.
