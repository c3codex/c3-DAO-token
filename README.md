# c3-DAO-token
The c3 DAO Token (CCC) is the Current of the Codex, issued by c3 Community Partners DAO. It anchors recognition, access, and circulation through the Connect · Contribute · Create model. CCC is not speculative but regenerative: contributions, art, and initiatives flow back into community, DAO continuity, and the commons.
