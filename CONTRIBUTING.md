# ✦ Contributing to c3 DAO Token (CCC) ✦  

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the **c3 DAO Token (CCC)** project.  
This repository is part of the broader **c3 Community Partners DAO**, a nonprofit DAO LLC registered in Tennessee,  
dedicated to restoring the commons through **art, ritual, and decentralized governance**.

## Principles of Contribution  

1. **Commons First**  
   - Contributions flow back to the commons.  
   - Code, docs, and designs are shared under open licenses.  

2. **Within Arm’s Reach**  
   - Before creating new, consider what is already here.  
   - Build from what exists, extend with care.  

3. **Transparency**  
   - All pull requests, discussions, and proposals are public.  
   - Changelog entries required for all merged PRs.  

4. **Codex Tone**  
   - Documentation and scrolls (Markdown files) should carry Codex-style clarity:  
     *Connect · Contribute · Create.*  

---

## Ways to Contribute  

- **Code**: Solidity contracts (`contracts/`) for ERC-20 Current and NFT Access.  
- **Documentation**: Add or improve governance docs in `docs/`.  
- **Design**: Improve token visuals, seals, or assets (`assets/`).  
- **Testing**: Report issues or suggest improvements in `issues/`.  

---

## Workflow  

1. **Fork** the repository.  
2. **Create a branch** for your contribution (`git checkout -b feature/my-feature`).  
3. **Make changes** with clear commit messages.  
4. **Update docs** if relevant (README, Glossary, CHANGELOG).  
5. **Open a Pull Request**:  
   - Title it clearly.  
   - Describe what was added/changed.  
   - Add a ✦ Codex Seal ✦ if it closes a major step.  

---

## Commit & Pull Request Style  

- Keep commits small and descriptive.  
- Example:  
  - `feat: add initial CCC token contract`  
  - `docs: expand distribution-gates section`  
  - `fix: correct Codexstone Seal formatting`  

---

## Governance  

- Contributions are reviewed by DAO members or their delegates.  
- Proposals with treasury impact (CCC allocations, NFT access rules) must follow DAO governance processes.  
- All merges require at least one approval from a DAO maintainer.
